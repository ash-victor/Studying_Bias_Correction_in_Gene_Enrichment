# gene_enrichment_project

The research aimed to build upon the Pregnancy, Race, Environment and Genes (PREG) study of DNA methylation levels in fetal tissue and gestational age at birth. The current study utilized the missMethyl R package that took multi-probe bias into account and enriched CpGs of specific genomic regions. A fundamental aspect of the study was to understand the differences between how current enrichment methods address multi-probe bias correction and employ one of these methods on the DNAm data from the PREG study.
